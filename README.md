# Neurabble
A neural net that will finally help you to win in the dobble boardgame!

In the ```notebooks/DobbleLabelling.ipynb``` you can see the data labelling process. To do that efficiently, I was using one of my
previous projects [ImageInspector](https://github.com/JanMalinowski/image_inspector).

Running ```sh create_data.sh``` will create the datasets containing names of two images and their common element.

TODO:
- Add images from more diversified backgrounds as the network seems not to be dealing well with images from different sources.
- Train a neural network
- Deploy an a simple webapp with the applicaiton.
